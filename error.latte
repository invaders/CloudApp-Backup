                        This app is really simple. We all like the cloud, our files on servers somewhere in the world and we can download them when ever we wish, even if our computer breaks. But files on other computers somwhere is not ideal for some of us, we like to have local backups.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <a href="http://www.cloudapp.com">CloudApp</a> is a brilliant service and you know that you can't export all your files from your account from one simple click. Well that is where this app comes into play.
                        <br/><br/>
                        With <a href="http://cloudapp.vaders.cz">CloudApp Downloader</a> all you do is just type in your <a href="http://www.cloudapp.com">CloudApp</a> credentials (don't worry we don't store anything, we use <a href="http://www.cloudapp.com">CloudApps</a> secure API), and our code does magically stuff and you will get a .zip with all you content. It really is that simple.

                        This app was made in 65 minutes because we are awesome like that. Idea by <a href="http://twitter.com/yogesh_n">Yogesh Nagarur</a> & Coded by <a href="http://twitter.com/tomikvitek">Tomas Vitek</a>.
